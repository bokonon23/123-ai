## Brief Introduction to Digital Money

Digital money represents a transformative shift in how we perceive and use currency. Unlike traditional forms tied to physical assets and government backing, digital money exists purely in electronic form. This evolution, driven by advancements in technology — particularly blockchain — provides a secure, decentralised framework for transactions.

As our world becomes increasingly digital, the significance of digital money is growing rapidly. It promises enhanced efficiency, reduced transaction costs, and greater accessibility. In a landscape where cash usage is declining, digital currencies offer a new means of exchange that transcends geographical boundaries.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping our understanding of transactions, particularly with the potential for AI-to-AI exchanges facilitated by self-custodied digital money. This shift empowers individuals with more autonomy over their finances while presenting challenges and opportunities for traditional financial systems.

A noteworthy aspect of this landscape is the widespread use of stablecoins, particularly **USDC** (Circle) and **USDT** (Tether), in international payment settlements. Currently, approximately 99% of stablecoin volume is denominated in dollars, effectively solidifying the U.S. dollar's status as the de facto digital currency for global transactions.

## The Landscape of Digital Money

Digital money encompasses various forms of currency that exist in electronic form, enabling transactions without the need for physical cash. Broadly, it can be categorised into two main types: cryptocurrencies and state-issued alternatives.

**Cryptocurrencies** are decentralised digital assets built on blockchain technology, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without central oversight. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and countless altcoins exemplify this category.

In contrast, **state-issued alternatives** refer to digital currencies backed by government entities — often called Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). These currencies aim to combine the benefits of digital money with the stability and regulatory framework of traditional fiat currencies. Countries like China, Sweden, and the Bahamas have already begun piloting or implementing their CBDCs.

## The Case for Self-Custodied Money

Self-custodied money refers to digital currency that individuals manage and control directly, without relying on intermediaries such as banks or payment processors. This concept is pivotal in the evolution of digital finance.

**Autonomy:** Self-custodied money empowers users by allowing them direct control over their funds, eliminating the need for third-party institutions that may impose restrictions or delays.

**Privacy:** Self-custodied money can facilitate anonymous exchanges, protecting users from the surveillance often associated with traditional banking.

**Speed:** Self-custodied money enables instant transactions, which is increasingly vital in our fast-paced digital economy. This immediacy is advantageous for AI-powered applications, facilitating real-time decision-making and automation.

## The Role of AI in Digital Transactions

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with self-custodied money heralds a new era of seamless and efficient digital transactions.

**Smart Contracts for Automated Agreements:** Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, automating various processes. In a real estate transaction, for example, a smart contract could manage the transfer of funds and ownership once predefined conditions are met — streamlining the process and minimising human error.

**AI Agents Negotiating and Executing Transactions Independently:** AI agents can analyse market conditions, assess risks, and make decisions on behalf of users — autonomously buying or selling assets using self-custodied funds.

## Cryptocurrency vs. State-Issued Alternatives

**Strengths of Cryptocurrencies:**
- *Decentralisation* — resistant to censorship and government control, allowing users to transact freely
- *Innovation* — the decentralised nature encourages rapid innovation, leading to diverse use cases from DeFi to NFTs

**Weaknesses of Cryptocurrencies:**
- *Regulatory hurdles* — significant challenges that can impede growth and acceptance
- *Trust issues* — public perception hurdles that can complicate mainstream acceptance

**Challenges for CBDCs:**
- Implementation infrastructure and cybersecurity requirements
- Public trust concerns around surveillance and data misuse

## Predictions for the Evolving Landscape

**Collaboration between private and public sectors:** We may see increasing partnerships that leverage the strengths of both cryptocurrency and government-issued alternatives.

**Coexistence of multiple forms of digital money:** Users may choose between self-custodied cryptocurrencies for autonomy and CBDCs for stability — creating a more resilient financial system that addresses various needs and preferences.

As we navigate the ongoing race for digital money dominance, self-custodied digital money is poised to emerge as a dominant force — particularly as AI-to-AI transactions become an increasingly real use case for borderless, programmable money.
