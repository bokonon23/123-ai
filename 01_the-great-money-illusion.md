## What is Money?

It seems at first to be a simple enough question.

However, a Google search or two later, and you will have a multitude of not-so-simple answers. It won't be long before you are contemplating Cowrie shells, Rai stones and the evolution of the banknote. You'll encounter various interpretations of history, enter into semantics of money versus currency, the gold standard and commodity money.

It's a fascinating world, but it adds up to more of an entire university curriculum than something that can be fully discussed in a blog post.

However, we can get to a working definition if we start from understanding 'modern money'. By 'modern money' I mean the money that we all typically know and use — government issued currency. If we use this as our point of reference we can avoid opinion on history and semantics, and work backwards as required.

On morning commutes, when a trek to the City was the regular grind, I used to read the financial pages of a newspaper as a shortcut to catching up on current affairs. Rather than domestic-focused opinion pieces, you could take a shortcut to a condensed view on global news events.

If an event is of enough importance it affects money, or at least some form of money market or share price. The financial markets' opinions on news stories could be read by price movements — a kind of 'skin-in-the-game' opinion that can be ascertained from the market's judgement.

And there itself is a glimpse into the world we don't often see. Money allows each of us, as individuals, access to all the things we have become dependent upon, which in turn consolidate into global demand patterns. In turn, money itself becomes the ultimate object of dependence.

**Our understanding of money typically forms more by a slow hypnosis from childhood than by way of structured learning.**

Unpicking that puzzle in our minds is a huge challenge, requiring the shedding of deeply held beliefs and abandonment of totemic imagery our minds have weaved together in an effort to make sense of it all.

Brett Scott, author of *Cloud-Money* and *The Heretic's Guide to Global Finance*, puts it like this:

> *"I sometimes get the feeling that if you look into the concept of money with too much scrutiny, it will simply disintegrate. Money is a bit like language: you are born in a given system, you grow up speaking a particular language and using a particular currency system but you seldom have any incentive to speculate on the essence of either systems."*
>
> *The first myth: money spontaneously emerged from barter — inaccurate. The second: money is a commodity with intrinsic value — it is truly nothing but a socially constructed claim on goods & services. The third: money is created by central banks — inaccurate. The vast majority is electronic, issued by commercial banks through fractional reserve banking.*

## War on Cash

Recently, there has been much debate about a global 'War on Cash'.

Cash has been marketed as 'outdated', a hygiene risk, and used for terrorist financing. The Covid saga expedited this story significantly. The idea of a cashless society was hailed as a user-led tech revolution. Cash is touted by many (particularly fintech companies) as an "outdated barrier to progress" that must give way to digital money.

But this is a very one-sided view. Cash protects privacy and is resilient in the face of natural disasters or banking failures. The digitalisation of money enables the further reach of global digital powerhouses such as US-based Amazon, Uber and Google, or China's Tencent and Alibaba.

The lack of privacy that comes with digital money creates a better environment for automated financial controls — billions of people becoming further locked into surveillance, their data extracted and exploited.

There appears to be a geopolitical struggle to lock people into abandoning cash. Concentrated interconnections of mega-bank, mega-corp and government end up locking people into products that will later study and exploit traits and behaviours. The push for a cashless society can be seen as an agent for a sinister force — not necessarily a concerted effort to deceive, but more a product of natural forces. Banks and corporations are rent-extracting and profit-seeking by nature; states naturally seek increasing power and control. The combination of these forces, unchecked, leads naturally — like a water course — towards a rather dystopian system of surveillance capitalism.

**Cash is a weapon against this.**

## Why Cash?

Physical cash — notes and coins — is the only 'real' money we have access to. The moment it is deposited into a bank, it becomes an IOU, and a balance sheet entry as a 'liability' to its users. Fractional reserve banking ensures that your deposit serves as collateral for lending by the bank. You are granted an IOU chip.

## Money: Comparisons to Blockchain

In the blockchain/cryptocurrency world, there is the concept of 'Layers' of settlement and operation. Layer 1 (L1) blockchains such as Ethereum are expensive and offer premium security. Layer 2s (L2) such as Arbitrum, Optimism and ZKSync periodically balance their books by settling on the L1s. In turn there are Layer 3s (L3) set to operate as 'appchains', with lower-security use cases settling back to L2.

The banking world is not dissimilar. Layer 1 being the state central banks, Layer 2 being the commercial banks that settle between themselves at the end of the day, and Layer 3s such as PayPal, Visa and Mastercard settling via Layer 2.

In this model, where is cash? Well, in theory at least, it could be a Layer 2 of its own. Cash enables peer-to-peer transactions with optional privacy — something increasingly difficult to achieve in the digital world.

## Digital Cash: Alternatives

Cash usage globally is still strong, increasing in fact in dollar terms, but also decreasing drastically in number of transactions. This is the effect of people drawing out money for storing instead of trusting banks.

The two key players — cryptocurrency and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) — have both so far failed the test.

Cryptocurrencies are still stuck with the problem of being either: a) pseudo-banking stablecoins, basically traceable and censorable representative tokens facilitated by the current banking system, or b) a proxy token for the US dollar to facilitate transactions, not a true unit of account.

CBDCs remain a possibility — if a central bank launched a credibly private alternative for peer-to-peer transactions and personal custody they could have a strong position. Far more likely, they will bend to temptation and use the CDBC for systems of monetary control and surveillance.

## Closing Thoughts

If you take away nothing more from this piece than the thought that perhaps, just maybe, cash is worth saving, then it was time well spent.

Cash is:
- The only real (government) money we have access to
- Offers unique features such as privacy, personal custody and peer-to-peer
- Offers a critical back-up function in the face of natural disasters, bank runs and cyber attacks

The checks and balances we have on our government (voting/democracy) and corporates (our custom) are strongly enhanced by cash continuing to exist.
