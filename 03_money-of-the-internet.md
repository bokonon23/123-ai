# What Will Be the Money of the Internet?

*Originally published on Blockstrata.co by Bruce Milligan — January 2023*

> **TLDR:** The current established systems for conducting commerce online have their limitations. These systems have not yet evolved to service the global and borderless nature of the internet, which is why there is a need for a global internet-native currency. A global internet-native currency, based on a cryptocurrency, would offer low transaction fees, a decentralised nature, and the ability to easily convert into different currencies. Such a system could facilitate micropayments, cross-border payments, and offer banking facilities to unbanked and under-banked individuals. It could also enable the Internet of Things (IoT) to easily and securely make financial transactions, and provide a platform for DeFi lending, borrowing, and trading. In the event a cryptocurrency protocol became a de facto internet standard, the most frequently traded asset would most likely be stablecoins.

## A Conversation Worth Having

Sometimes, for those of us who have been working in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world for some time, it is easy to get lost in the detail. Newcomers, sceptics or curious friends might ask about why they should take an interest in this area. So here is an attempt to explain the basics through the format of a conversation with a friend who has barely any awareness of cryptocurrency, or why they should care.

---

**Me:** So what do you think will be the Money of the internet?

**Friend:** The internet already has money. I don't have any problem making payments on Amazon or buying the weekly groceries. I use PayPal, credit cards, bank transfers, Venmo — there are a thousand payment service providers competing to service my payments. The costs are largely negligible and I don't notice. What makes you think the golden age of commerce on the internet isn't already here?

**Me:** Do you think that's it? The way I see it, we recreated the high street online and made digital versions of the old analogue bank services. Did you not think there could be more?

Here's a thought: every time you use a browser you see the familiar lock icon in the address bar. That indicates a site is secured by HTTPS. That standard for securing web traffic is similar to how IMAP and POP became the standard for email, FTP for file transfer, and so on.

So far there has been no establishment of an internet standard for financial transactions. The underlying 'money' is still cumbersome and not fit for a truly borderless and unleashed internet. But say a cryptocurrency protocol became successful as a settlement layer for internet commerce — it could replace or at least offer a practical alternative to the legacy financial system. It would be operated independently of institutions, natively on the open internet.

---

**Friend:** OK — I can see what might be exciting about that. But how realistic is it?

**Me:** For an open-source protocol to become widely adopted as the settlement layer for internet commerce, it would need years of stress-testing to 'prove' it is a sound financial protocol. Right now, there are protocols such as the popular Ethereum network, which has been running since 2015 and steadily gaining trust within the industry.

---

**Friend:** Why Ethereum? I thought Bitcoin was the leader?

**Me:** I used Ethereum as an example due to the current active developers, the dollar value locked into the protocol, and its advantage over Bitcoin for having a dedicated layer for smart contract processing. Having said that, the market is still evolving and other cryptocurrencies or technologies could emerge to challenge Ethereum's dominance.

---

**Friend:** What's so great about decentralised protocols? Why can't the existing system serve this need?

**Me:** Despite the internet being borderless and global by nature, it is still governed largely by the currencies of the nation states they originate and land in. Friction exists in making payments and many people are locked out of using credit cards and bank accounts. The promise of inclusivity and onboarding billions to trade has not yet been realised.

Let me give you a few concrete reasons why 'the internet' might need its own native currency.

**1. Micropayments are not viable on the old system.**

Micropayments refer to small financial transactions — certainly less than a dollar, and in many cases less than 1 cent. These types of payments are often too small to be processed by traditional financial systems. Low transaction fees make crypto well-suited for facilitating micropayments.

For a variety of reasons, the internet emerged with an advertising-centric model of paying the creators of content. Because of that, as consumers we are harvested for our data, mercilessly advertised 'at' and presented with information designed to get us to buy and consume. A perfect internet money protocol could flip this model and allow micropayments to reward content creators directly in peer-to-peer relationships with their consumers. The ability to pay say $0.01 to view a webpage, processed automatically from a wallet you own and control — received directly by the creator — might make it more viable for creators to create.

**2. The Internet of Things (IoT).**

The IoT refers to the interconnection of everyday devices — smart appliances, sensors — through the internet. A global internet-native currency would make it possible for these devices to easily and securely make financial transactions, such as paying for data or access to services.

We have moved beyond it just being humans that need payment facilities. Machines will need means of payment and receipt for services — imagine a vending machine that can reorder its own stock, or driverless cars refuelling themselves. In the traditional world, a human would need to sit behind the account and these things are hard to operate programmatically. Not so with smart contracts and crypto payments.

**3. Cross-border payments.**

Financial transactions that involve different countries and currencies can be costly and time-consuming. There is no reason to still be taking 3-5 days and $30 to send funds across borders. Instant payments with negligible transaction fees are the way of the future.

**4. Financial inclusion.**

Crypto provides an alternative banking facility to unbanked and under-banked individuals — giving them access to new economic opportunities through a mobile device.

**Friend:** What about smart contracts? You mentioned them earlier.

**Me:** Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. They can automatically enforce the rules and penalties of an agreement without a middleman. This is also the reason Ethereum supports NFTs, DeFi, gaming, and many other features.

---

**Friend:** What is stopping all this from happening already?

**Me:** A few things. Governments are still developing regulations for cryptocurrency, and some may choose to ban it outright. Cryptocurrency is still relatively new and there are trust issues. It can still be difficult for the average person to use. And other technologies such as CBDCs may potentially offer many of the same benefits.

---

**Friend:** How would you summarise the 'bull case'?

**Me:** While we have various forms of online payment today, the current system has not evolved to service the global and borderless nature of the internet. Cryptocurrency offers low transaction fees, a decentralised nature, and the ability to easily convert into different currencies.

If a cryptocurrency protocol becomes widely adopted as the settlement layer for internet commerce, it could be indicated by its logo being displayed in the browser bar — similar to the way HTTPS websites show a lock symbol, indicating security and trust. If you imagine a world where this is a reality, it's hard not to get excited about how one might be able to profit from that — in the same way there were many winners in the early internet era.

At the root, all of humanity's achievements trace back to our ability for grand-scale coordination. What has been created with the advent of cryptocurrency protocols is a way of coordinating economic activity with tamper-proof ledgers that are not owned by anyone — and therefore are a shield against corruption.
